When creating the MSET9 ID1 on Windows 10 and up, the script sometimes fails with this error:

![Error 18](/images/screenshots/troubleshooting/234.png)

This occurs because of the in-beta UTF-8 support in Windows. Instructions to disable it are as follows:

1. Hit **Windows Key + R** to open up the Run dialogue, type `intl.cpl` then click "OK"

1. Uncheck the box next to `Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support` then click "OK"

After your PC has rebooted, try creating the MSET9 ID1 again.
