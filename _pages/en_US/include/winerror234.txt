When creating the MSET9 ID1 on Windows 10 and up, the script sometimes crashes with this error:

`OSError: [WinError 234] More data is available: '[X]:\\Nintendo 3DS/################################/\uffff\ufaff餑䠇䚅敩 ꄈ∁䬅䞘䙨䙙ꫀᰗ䙃䰃䞠䞸退ࠊꁱࠅ캙ࠄsdmc退ࠊb9'`

This occurs because of the in-beta UTF-8 support in Windows. Instructions to disable it are as follows:

Hit **Windows Key + R** to open up the Run dialogue, type `intl.cpl` then click "OK"

Uncheck the box next to `Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support` then click "OK"

Click "Restart Now"

After your PC has rebooted, try creating the MSET9 ID1 again.
